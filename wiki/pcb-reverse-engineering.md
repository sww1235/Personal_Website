# PCB Reverse Engineering

## Schematic Capture {#schematic-capture}

## Circuit Analysis [#circuit-analysis}

The first step in this type of circuit analysis I have found, is to attempt to
simplify the circuit as much as possible. This means:

-	remove any jumpers in circuit
-	add in ground and power symbols to reduce clutter
-	attempt to identify common circuit elements
	-	Utilize the manual for the device you are reverse engineering if
		possible. This can give clues about certain portions of the circuit.

## A Non Exhaustive List of Common Circuit Elements {#common-elements}

-	darlington pair, with or without base-emitter bypass resistor
-	op amps
