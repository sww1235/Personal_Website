<h2 id="analysis">Circuit Analysis</h2>

The first step in this type of circuit analysis I have found, is to attempt to
simplify the circuit as much as possible. This means:
- remove any jumpers in circuit
- add in ground and power symbols to reduce clutter
- attempt to identify common circuit elements
	- Utilize the manual for the device you are reverse engineering if possible. This can give clues about certain portions of the circuit.

- darlington pair, with or without base-emitter bypass resistor
- op amps
