# <a name="Contributing"></a>Contributing



This is my personal wiki. It is meant to document and collate research so I am
only subjet to the whims of my own equipment, not the internet.

This contributing guide is as much for me as for anyone else, so that when I
come back to this, I can remember the format and purpose.

## File Format

The file format is using markdown, and is as follows.

-   The first line is the page title using one \#
-   At the end, put a tag block, which is a code block using ```` ``` ````, with
the language indication as `tag`
-   Use `<a name="name"></a>` in between each header start and the header text. This
can be linked to with `[name](#name)` The `name` should be all lowercase.
