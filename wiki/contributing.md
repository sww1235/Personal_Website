# Contributing

This is my personal wiki. It is meant to document and collate research so I am
only subject to the whims of my own equipment, not the internet.

This contributing guide is as much for me as for anyone else, so that when I
come back to this, I can remember the format and purpose.

## Content {#content-guidelines}

## File Format {#file-format}

The file format is using markdown, and is as follows.

-	The first line is the page title using a level 1 header with markdown syntax `#`

-	At the end, put a tag block, which is a code block using ```` ``` ````, with
	the language indication as `tags`

-	Headers shall use ATX markdown header synax (enforced by lint rules), and
	pandoc style header id tags `{#tag}`
