<h1 id="top">Contributing</h1>



This is my personal wiki. It is meant to document and collate research so I am
only subject to the whims of my own equipment, not the internet.

This contributing guide is as much for me as for anyone else, so that when I
come back to this, I can remember the format and purpose.

<h2 name="content-guidelines">Content</h2>

-

<h2 name="file-format">File Format</h2>

The file format is using markdown, and is as follows.

-   The first line is the page title using a header tag with the h1 header level
and `id="top"`

-   At the end, put a tag block, which is a code block using ```` ``` ````, with
the language indication as `tags`

-   Use standard HTML header tags instead of markdown `#` headers like
`<h2 id="name">Name</h2>` in order to comply with HTML5 specs as the `<a>`
tag has no name attribute any more. This can be linked to with `[name](#name)`
The `id` should be all lowercase. This will create a page relative link.

-   First and second level headers are mandatory to contain relative links.
Lower headers are optional.
