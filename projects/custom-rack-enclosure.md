# Custom Rack Enclosure

Things I would do differently on a second iteration:

- Assemble the whole box at once using brad nails and glue ala Adam Savage, then cut off the various panels and pocket screw them to the frame. Will have to adjust the design to account for this. This will allow all wood grains to match up better and eliminate the patching and sanding in order to get things to line up properly.

- Make the rear door deeper to accommodate back to front mounted switches.

- Leave more space between connectors on patch panel, as well as more space around the outside to prevent crowding of connector mounting screws on outer ring.

- Either designed a custom metal enclosure for the 120V power or integrated screw holes for the standard 4x4 box and extension ring I used so they could attach flush to the main plate.

- Maybe made the plate a bit thicker and used tapped holes rather than nuts and bolts.

- Instead of making a cabinet for one 25U rack, I should have done 2 side by side 12U racks to lower the COG and allow it to be pushed easier.
