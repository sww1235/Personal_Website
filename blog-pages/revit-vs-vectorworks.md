after having used both Revit and Vectorworks, these are my first impressions of
both softwares

Revit is much less user friendly, more complex but much more powerful. It has a
small standard libarary of doors and windows, hardware, etc, but if you want to
introduce anything custom, there is a larger amount of work involved as Revit
lacks the powerful door and window tools of Vectorworks by default. There are
Revit plugins you can buy to duplicate this functionality, or you can spend a
disproportionate amount of time designing custom families if you need custom
products.

Revit has a much better MEP toolset then Vectorworks as well as integrates the
structural model of the building much better. Their structural members tool
actually **works** and can be used to do structural analysis of the building.

Revit has a much larger userbase and is supported by Autodesk's large community forumns.
